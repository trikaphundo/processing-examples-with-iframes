    <!--Insert the version with no iframe in this iframe-->
    <div id="example-cover">
      <iframe src="sketch-no-iframe.html"></iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p>The P5js library and the sketch are both loaded in the iframe element,
    which acts as its new window; thus the sketch only responds to interaction
    happening <strong>inside</strong> its window (iframe).</p>
    
    <p>This is because P5js registers event handlers to the window of the
    document it is loaded in, which in this case is the iframe, not the top
    window.</p>
    
    <p>This example also gives a <em>suggestion</em> of how the Processing example
    webpages could implement this change</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the div with id "example-cover", that currently wraps
      the canvas, or the image is a p5js script is not available.</li>
      
      <li>If a p5js sketch is available, insert an iframe in the
      previous div. Giving iframe the 640x360px dimensions, instead of doing so
      in the sketch with the "createCanvas(640, 360)", which shall be changed to
      "createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)" so that it fills the iframe.</li>
    </ul>
    
    The little problem is that every sketch createCanvas statement must be
    modified. Nevertheless, <em>another option</em> which will not require
    making any changes to existing sketches is
    
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the div with id "example-cover", that currently wraps
      the canvas, or the image is a p5js script is not available.</li>
      
      <li>If a p5js sketch is available, insert an iframe in the
      previous div. Without setting the iframe's dimensions, which will be
      infered from its content: the dimensions of the canvas (640x360px) given
      in the sketch with the "createCanvas(640, 360)".</li>
    </ul>
