    <!--Insert the version with no iframe in this iframe-->
    <iframe src="sketch-no-iframe.html" width="500px" height="500px"></iframe>
    
    <p>The P5js library and the sketch are both loaded in the iframe element,
    which acts as its new window; thus the sketch only responds to interaction
    happening <strong>inside</strong> its window (iframe).</p>
    
    <p>This is because P5js registers event handlers to the window of the
    document it is loaded in, which in this case is the iframe, not the top
    window.</p>
